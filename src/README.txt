In the project terminal, you can run:

    "npm start"
    This runs the app in the development mode.
    You can also open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Once on a local host on web browser:

    * the default screen should be the GroupSearch page

To view the webite screen on the correct Iphone screen:

    1. Right click anywhere on the current screen
    2. Select "Inspect" from the given list
    3. On the very top right of the browser there should be a dropdown that says
    "Dimensions Responsive" 
    4. After clicking this text, select "Iphone SE". 
    5. This should correctly format the screen that matches our code. 

We currently have built three screens via HTML/CSS. To view the other screens:

    * In the search bar of the localhost browser add either
        1. "/userprofile"
            or
        2. "/requestgroup"
        to the end of the link to access the other Iphone pages.
    * The link should look like:
        1. http://localhost:3000/userprofile
            or
        2. http://localhost:3000/requestgroup

The only outside resources/ tools we used in this code were downloaded images from the 
internet that are all currently in the /src/images folder.
